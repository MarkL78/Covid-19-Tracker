# Covid-19-Tracker
Some code that creates a few charts to try and find if there is a correlation between Covid-19, GDP, and other factors. Hoping to expand it in the future to scrape data from the web to update the charts 

FYI: FAIR WARINING SINCE THIS IS PUBLIC CODE ANY STUDENTS TRYING TO USE ANY PART OF IT WILL BE CAUGHT BE THEIR SCHOOL'S PLAGERISM SOFTWARE. LIKE DON"T EVEN TRY IT YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
